How to Watch Leicester City vs Arsenal: Live Stream Premier League Soccer, TV Channel

Leicester City faces Arsenal in a crucial Premier League clash this Saturday morning at King Power Stadium in Leicester, Leicestershire.

Leicester v Arsenal LIVE: Line-ups as Raheem Sterling starts Premier League clash for Gunners
Mikel Arteta’s injury hit side look to close the gap on Liverpool at the top of the Premier League

Leicester City host Arsenal in the Premier League’s early kick-off today, with the injury hit visitors looking to close the gap on Liverpool in the title race.

The Gunners have the chance to go within four points of the league leaders after Everton denied the Reds victory with a late equaliser in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday. Arsenal were dealt a major blow in midweek, though, as Kai Havertz tore his hamstring to join Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus on the sidelines.

It could lead to a much-changed forward line for Arteta’s side as they face a struggling Leicester side who sit 18th. Ruud van Nistelrooy has endured a difficult start to life at the King Power, and his side remain two points away from safety ahead of a tricky run of fixtures.

Ian Wright urges Raheem Sterling to take Arsenal chance
Ian Wright fears Raheem Sterling could “go out with a whimper” unless the forward finds a way to make his Arsenal loan a success and steps up following Kai Havertz’s “devastating” injury.

Mikel Arteta’s Gunners are seven points behind leaders Liverpool in the Premier League title race and have seen hopes of catching them dented by some key attacking injuries.

Bukayo Saka has been out since December with a hamstring issue and Gabriel Jesus last month saw his campaign brought to a premature end by an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

Arsenal tried to sign Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins during a fruitless winter window that been followed by reports that Havertz suffered a season-ending hamstring tear during the club’s warm-weather camp in Dubai.

Can Raheem Sterling finally get his Arsenal career going?
Raheem Sterling is awarded a rare start for the Gunners today as Mikel Arteta looks to roll with the punches following Kai Havertz’s season-ending injury.

Arsenal are now seriously lacking in attacking options and will be ever grateful if Sterling, who arrived from rivals Chelsea on loan in the summer, can finally rediscover his form of old.

Against relegation-threatened Leicester, the King Power Stadium provides the perfect stage for the ex-Man City and Liverpool man to show his worth.


Can Ethan Nwaneri play No 9?
The talented teenager has already scored seven first-team goals for Arsenal this season and Arteta believes he has the “qualities” to play centrally as well as out wide.

Nwaneri is just two goals off the record set by Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney for most senior goals before turning 18 - he does not turn 18 until 21 March.

"It's a question of when,” Arteta said when asked if Nwaneri could play down the middle. “He has the right qualities, to play out wide or centrally. We must adapt to the strengths of our players."
